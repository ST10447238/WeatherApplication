#Design
This application, which shows the  3 activity main layout and 3 main activity that is important to use when starting an application . Basically, this is a weather / application which is made up of elements from the palette and it also has constrains. It consists of elements such as 6buttons, 2textViews,  1 plain text and a background images. These elements are important because it will be used by the user to check or input data. Each element in this image above has its own role and function in this application, therefore I had to drag and drop the elements from the palette that I needed for the app. I started by dragging and dropping the first text view which I had to rename it as the "Weather application‚Äù which is the heading of the app and what the app is about.
The provided code is for a weather application's main activity in Android. It initializes an array of `WeatherData` objects, each representing a day of the week with minimum and maximum temperatures and a condition. The activity has four buttons: Compute, Clear, Exit, and Average. The Compute button starts a new activity, passing the `weeklyWeatherArray` as an intent extra. The Clear button clears the user input and text view. The Exit button starts a new activity, presumably the main activity of the application. The Average button calculates the average temperature for the week by summing up the minimum and maximum temperatures for each day and dividing by the total number of temperatures (14 in this case). The result is then displayed in a text view. The activity also initializes an edit text for user input, although it's not clear what this input is used for.
